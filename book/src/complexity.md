# Complexity Analysis

### Time complexity
- **Worst case**: O(n²)
  - Occurs when the array is in reverse order.
- **Best case**: O(n) *(with optimized bubble sort)*
  - Occurs when the array is already sorted.
- **Average case**: O(n²)

### Space complexity
- O(1) — in-place sorting algorithm.
- Only requires a constant amount of extra space.
