# Conclusion

This report compared different implementations of the bubble sort algorithm in Rust.

The bubble sort algorithm has clear limitations in efficiency, especially as the number of elements increases.

Benchmarking shows that, depending on actual usage, the benefits of optimizations may not always be realized. As a developer, understanding use cases is crucial for making informed design trade-offs.

Rust provides a comprehensive suite of tools to assist with development.

Rust achieves high performance in part due to its borrow checker, which runs at compile time and avoids runtime overhead compared to languages like Python and Java.
